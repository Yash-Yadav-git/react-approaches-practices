# react-approaches-pratices
This Repo would basically contain different approaches used while making react application , it can be state-management , fetching , and many more .
This repo could potentially be a good learning curve for people who are starting out with react . 

For HACKTOBERFEST <br />
-> what ever feature that you people will be working on , i would recommend rather then copy/pasting the code from some source , try to understand the concept and ideology behind it and only then commit the code , because that way you will learn both the conceptual side and implementation side of it , it's for you own good :)

Things to remember before commiting <br />
-> Have both conceptual and understanding of implementation of whatever code you will be commiting (if you don't know then simplest thing is go ahead , read on whatever the topic is , understand implementation) . Whatever you are commiting , you can document about that approach , it's usage , pros,cons.
All of this will be checked only approvals goes ahead . 

-> Try to follow good coding practices 

Steps for the feature implementation: <br />
-> Create a documentation file for whatever feature/approach that you are mentioning . <br />
-> Create a route and then create a super short application over that route to demonstrate functionality of that feature (super important). <br />
-> If you have some specific folder structure , you can mention that in documentation file. <br />
